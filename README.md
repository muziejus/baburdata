# Bāburdata / بابرڈیٹا

A reworking of the [XPMethod
_Bāburnāma_](http://github.com/xpmethod/baburnama) project, “Bāburdata” is a
research project led by [Moacir P. de Sá Pereira](http://moacir.com)
([@muziejus](http://github.com/muziejus)) and [Manan
Ahmed](https://history.columbia.edu/faculty/manan-ahmed/)
([@mananahmed](http://github.com/mananahmed)). The original project began
with geo-tagging and mapping all of the placenames in the life-writing of
[Zahīruddīn Bābur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babur) (1483–1530), commonly titled
[_Bāburnāma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baburnama). We aim to produce a series
of visualizations based on the ways in which the text speaks about
geographical places and settings and the ways in which Bābur describes his
emotions at various sites.

The earlier project relied on the [recent translation of the
text](https://www.worldcat.org/title/baburnama-memoirs-of-babur-prince-and-emperor/oclc/1015528859&referer=brief_results)
by Wheeler M. Thackston. This version, however, will rely on _The Bābur-nāma
in English_, a translation by Annette Beveridge published in 1921. This
translation is available [for partner institution download from
HathiTrust](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011261317) and, importantly
for our purposes, also [available as a human-edited text file from Project
Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44608), made possible by the
efforts of Barbara Tozier, Turgut Dincer, Bill Tozier, and the [Online
Distributed Proofreading Team](http://www.pgdp.net). 

## “Building a Digital _Bāburnāma_”

This XPMethod project, code-named “Bāburdata,” aims to build a digital
version of Annette Beveridge’s 1912–1922 translation of Emperor Bābur’s 1530
memoir, _Bāburnāma_. We will build a rich collection of datasets around the
work, tracking places mentioned, people, their relationships to each other,
and various sentiments, laying the groundwork for a gazetteer of medieval
Central Asia.

## Preliminary Research Questions

* How does named entity recognition compare with manual annotation on a twentieth-century translation of a sixteenth-century text?
* What geospatial narrative does Bābur encode in the memoir?
* How turbulent are Bābur’s relationships with other people in the text?
* How does Bābur related to place? Is there a map of “Happy Bābur” and a map
of “Sad Bābur”?

## Phase I (2019–2020)

* Geospatially annotated digital Beveridge translation
* Comparison of manual and computer-driven geospatial entity recognition
* Co-authored publication

## Later Phases

* Biographical annotation
* Network of persons and relations
* API access to datasets
* Reconciliation/synthesis with other editions

## Collaborators Will Gain Familiarity With

* Versioning and data management with Git
* (Geo)Data analysis and (geospatial) visualization with Python and JavaScript
* Named Entity Recognition with Python 
* Graph analysis
* Secondary source historical research
* Perso-Arabic script
* [Node Express Server](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Ember](https://emberjs.com) JavaScript frontend framework
